# Specification

See the [OpenMP home page](http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-specifications/) for the latest specification.

On Blue Gene/Q, the IBM XL compilers provide support for OpenMP v3.1. The GNU compilers provide support for OpenMP v3.0, although .  LLVM does not yet support OpenMP on any platform.

More information about OpenMP support in GCC can be found at http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/openmp and http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/gomp/.

# Documentation

The [LLNL OpenMP page](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/) is the best description I've found anywhere.  Blaise Barney is awesome.

NERSC has an [OpenMP tutorial](http://www.nersc.gov/assets/Uploads/IntroToOpenMP.pdf) as well.
