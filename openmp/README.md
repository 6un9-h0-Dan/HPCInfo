# Specification

See the [OpenMP home page](http://openmp.org/wp/openmp-specifications/) for the latest specification.

See [OpenMP Compiler Support](http://www.openmp.org/resources/openmp-compilers/) for information about which compilers support various features of the OpenMP standard.

More information about OpenMP support in GCC can be found at http://gcc.gnu.org/wiki/openmp and http://gcc.gnu.org/projects/gomp/.

# Documentation

The [LLNL OpenMP page](https://computing.llnl.gov/tutorials/openMP/) is the best description I've found anywhere.  Blaise Barney is awesome.

NERSC has an [OpenMP tutorial](http://www.nersc.gov/assets/Uploads/IntroToOpenMP.pdf) as well.

The [Parallel Research Kernels](https://github.com/ParRes/Kernels) project has examples of modern OpenMP usage (e.g. tasks, taskloop, target)in C++11, C11, and Fortran 2008.
