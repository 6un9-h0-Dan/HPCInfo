= Definition =

PAMI stands for Parallel Active Messaging Interface and is produced by IBM.

= Source Code =

See [[Blue Gene/Q#Source Code|Blue Gene/Q Source Code]] instructions for how to obtain the open-source implementation of PAMI for Blue Gene/Q.  The implementation on other platforms is not currently open-source.

== API Documentation ==

See <tt>pami.h</tt>.

== Doxygen ==

EPFL hosts this at https://bgq1.epfl.ch/navigator/resources/doc/pami/index.html

== Programming Guide ==

[http://publibfp.dhe.ibm.com/epubs/pdf/a2322733.pdf PAMI Programming Guide] was the first publicly available documentation of the PAMI API.  Please note that this document is about the AIX implementation of PAMI.  This document was originally full of errors and still may not be correct in all cases.  Please always verify syntax with <tt>pami.h</tt> on your system.

= Portability =

PAMI is described on slides 13 and 14 of [http://www.lanl.gov/orgs/hpc/salishan/salishan2011/1wisniewski.pdf Bob Wisniewski's Salishan 2011 talk].

The following diagram is extracted from those slides:

= Source =

PAMI is part of the driver that you can download by following the directions [https://wiki.alcf.anl.gov/parts/index.php/Blue_Gene/Q#Source_Code here].

= Examples =

I put all of my code online here: http://code.google.com/p/pami-examples/.  I do not intend to maintain the code listed below.

== Using multiple clients ==

PAMI supports multiple clients, e.g., MPI and ARMCI, MPI and UPC, MPI and CAF, etc.  Using a PAMI clients (e.g. MPI) with an SPI client (e.g. the lattice QCD codes) requires different resource control.

The client name 'MPI' is reserved by MPI and should not be used by any client that intends to inter-operate with the provided MPI library.

This test demonstrates how to use multiple clients:

<pre>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <assert.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <pami.h>

int main(int argc, char* argv[])
{
  pami_result_t result = PAMI_ERROR;

  /* initialize the client1 */
  char * client1name = "CLIENT1";
  pami_client_t client1;
  result = PAMI_Client_create(client1name, &client1, NULL, 0);
  assert(result == PAMI_SUCCESS);

  char * client2name = "CLIENT2";
  pami_client_t client2;
  result = PAMI_Client_create(client2name, &client2, NULL, 0);
  assert(result == PAMI_SUCCESS);

  /* finalize the client1 */
  result = PAMI_Client_destroy(&client2);
  assert(result == PAMI_SUCCESS);

  result = PAMI_Client_destroy(&client1);
  assert(result == PAMI_SUCCESS);

  printf("end of test \n");
  fflush(stdout);
  sleep(1);

  return 0;
}
</pre>

You can submit with <tt> qsub -t 5 -n 1 --mode c1 --env PAMI_CLIENTS=CLIENT1,CLIENT2 ./clients.x </tt>.
