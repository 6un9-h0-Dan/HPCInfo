Coupled cluster is denoted CC throughout.

## Books

[Molecular Electronic-Structure Theory](http://www.amazon.com/Molecular-Electronic-Structure-Theory-Trygve-Helgaker/dp/0471967556) is the bible of quantum chemistry and has a good chapter on CC.  The price of this book is ridiculous and the publisher should be ashamed of what they are doing.

[Many-Body Methods in Chemistry and Physics](http://www.amazon.com/Many-Body-Methods-Chemistry-Physics-Coupled-Cluster/dp/052181832X) is the authoritative book on CC.

## Reviews

[Crawford and Schaefer](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470125915.ch2/summary) is the best review on CC for beginners.  [A preprint](https://wiki.alcf.anl.gov/parts/images/6/6a/CrawfordCC.pdf) is available for those who don't have access to the published version.

[Bartlett's review](http://rmp.aps.org/abstract/RMP/v79/i1/p291_1) is an expert-level summary.

## Articles

[Monkhorst's paper](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/qua.560120850/abstract) is how I learned response theory.

[Stanton's first paper on EOM](http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v98/i9/p7029_s1)

[Stanton's on EOM second-derivatives](http://jcp.aip.org/resource/1/jcpsa6/v103/i20/p8931_s1) contains just about everyone one should know about the working equations thereof.

## Other

[My thesis](http://dx.doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.967859) derives the equations of response theory in some detail.

## Papers

[This](http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jp034596z) is the original TCE paper by So Hirata.

[This paper](http://www.csc.lsu.edu/~gb/TCE/Publications/SynthApproach-ProcIEEE05.pdf) covers some of the computer science aspects of TCE.
