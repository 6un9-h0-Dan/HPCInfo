= Mac =

Macports was giving me hell so I switched to Homebrew.  The following build uses GCC 4.8.

Configure:
<pre>
./configure --prefix=$HOME/software/cfour \
./configure CC=gcc FC=gfortran \
--with-blas="pthread -framework Accelerate" 
</pre>

<tt>pthread</tt> there since this option is pre-prepended with "-l"

Or you can skip BLAS/LAPACK at configure time and change lines 83 and 84 of <tt>make.config</tt> to the following:
<pre>
BLAS_LIBS=-framework Accelerate
LAPACK_LIBS=-framework Accelerate
</pre>

Compile it:
<pre>
make -j4
</pre>
