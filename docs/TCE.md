# Overview

TCE is short for Tensor Contraction Engine.  It is an overloaded term that refers to, among other things, the automatic code generation project led by Sadayappan, an implementation of some of the ideas of said project by Hirata, and the module in NWChem that includes code generated by Hirata's implementation.

I'll try to put more information here in the future.
